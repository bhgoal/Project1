# Project1
Our web application displays a daily horoscope in addition to the NASA astronomy photo of the day. We utilized HTML, CSS, Materialize, JavaScript, NASA Astronomy Photo of the Day API, astrologyAPI, and Firebase.
On the main page, 12 astrological sign buttons are displayed. The user selects their sign by clicking on the appropriate button.  If the user is unsure of which sign to choose, the sun button in the center of the screen will display sign info and dates when clicked. The user then sees their daily horoscope and a NASA photo displayed to the page.
While the horoscope and photo are shown, the sun will transfer to the upper left hand corner. The sun can be clicked again to display the home page.
